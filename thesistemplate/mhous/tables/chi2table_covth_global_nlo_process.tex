\caption{The values of the $\chi^2/N_{\rm dat}$ and of the $\phi$ estimator
  in the NNPDF3.1 global fits
  with the theory covariance matrix $S$, compared to the results based on including only
  the experimental covariance matrix $C$. Results are shown
for  the 9-, 7-, and 3- point prescriptions.
  %
  For the 9-point prescription we also show  results obtained
  including the theory covariance matrix
only in the $\chi^2$ definition Eq.~(\ref{eq:chi2_v3}) but not
in the data generation Eq.~(\ref{eq:dgen}) and conversely.
  Values corresponding to the
  NNLO fit with  experimental covariance matrix $C$ only are also shown.
