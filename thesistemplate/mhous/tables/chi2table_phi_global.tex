\caption{$\phi$ for fits
  with $S$ compared to without. Results are shown
for  the 9-, 7-, and 3- point prescriptions.
  %
  For 9-point the impact is broken down by inclusion of $S$ in 
  either fitting ($S_{fit}$) or sampling ($S_{sampl}$) only.
  The final column is a comparison to the NNLO $C$ only fit.
