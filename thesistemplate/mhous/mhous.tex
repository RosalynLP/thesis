\item MHOUs dominate theoretical uncertainties in LHC
\item To estimate MHOU, standard is scale var of $\mu_r$ amd $\mu_f$ - refs for cons/alternatives e.g. Cacciari-Houdeau, but this is widely applicable to all procs and builds in the correlations e.g. between similar kinematic regions
\item Could use another method in the Bayesian framework though, using this for MHOUs
\item MHOUs not yet included in PDF fits
\item MHOUs used to be small, esp since NNLO PDFs emerged
\item In 3.1 electroweak scale, unc down to 1\% level, and QCD MHOU is at \% level
\item MHOUs can increase/decrease weights of experiments in the fit
\item Here we formulate inclusion, include at NLO, verify against NNLO (including developing verification methods/tools) and assess impact on pheno
