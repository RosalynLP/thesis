First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisor, Richard Ball, for his support and guidance in this project, and for steering me towards a fascinating and cohesive area of research. I have benefited very much from his insightful perspective, and meticulous understanding of the interplay of ingredients in PDF fits. Important thanks also go to Emanuele Nocera, who helped me find my feet in the early days of my PhD, and has been immensely helpful and supportive throughout, above and beyond what I could have hoped for. Without him I am not sure I would be writing this thesis! Also to Zahari Kassabov for his perpetual presence on GitHub, answering thousands of questions and helping me to develop good coding practices. 

I have also met some lovely people in NNPDF, of which there are too many to list here. But in particular I would like to mention Mikey and Tommaso, the Edinburgh students in my year. They have helped me out more times than I can count with my research and with the code development, and I was very happy to share an office with them. I also really enjoyed collaborating closely with Cameron during the first couple of years. Thanks also go to Rabah and Shayan. Finally, I would like to thank Emma for helping me stick through the tougher moments, and providing mentorship from the year above. 

Outwith my PhD I have had a tough few years and I would like to thank my sister Julia, my partner Fred and my best friend Eleanor, all of whom I have also lived with. In particular, thanks to Eleanor for her help with the artwork for some of the figures. 

Finally, this research has been made possible through the UK Science and Technologies Funding Council grant ST/R504737/1.
