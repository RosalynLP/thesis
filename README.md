# Theory uncertainties in parton distribution functions

This is the source code for my thesis which can be found [here](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/38570).

## Code layout

* `diagrams` contains code and output for .tex diagrams e.g. Feynman diagrams

* `vp-plots` contains code (`python` scripts and `yaml` runcards for [nnpdf](https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf)) and outputs for various PDF plots

* `thesistemplate` contains the .tex code for the thesis itself, with a sub-folder for each chapter (including a couple which didn't appear :) )
